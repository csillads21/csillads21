**Bonjour** ðŸ‘‹
 

I'm a Java software engineer, developing web applications. I help professional SW engineers working on data-intensive apps to develop efficient and intuitive data visualizations so they can work on challenging projects.

You can find my published articles on [GitHub Pages](https://csillaszanto.github.io/ "GH Pages"), more coming soon...
